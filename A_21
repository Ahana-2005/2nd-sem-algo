//Write a C program to calculate the Fibonacci series using recursion.
1. Start.
2. Prompt the user to enter the limit for the number of Fibonacci numbers.
3. Print the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
4. Call the fib function with initial values 0 and 1, and the limit n-2.
5. Base Case: If n is not greater than 0, return.
Recursive Case: Calculate the next Fibonacci number as the sum of a and b.
6. Print the new Fibonacci number.
7. End.
