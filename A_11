//Write an algorithm for a c program to print all the even numbers from an array.
1. Start.
2. Input from user the value of n.
3. Array declaration of n size.
4. Input elements.
5. Find and print even elements by initializing a variable count to 0 and for each index i from 0 to n-1, check if arr[i] is divisible by 2 (i.e., arr[i] % 2 == 0).
6. Print arr[i] and increment count by 1.
7. Check for even elements by checking if count is 0, print "There are no even numbers".
8. End.
