//Write an algorithm for a C program to find the smallest number of an array.
1. Start.
2. Input from user the value of n.
3. Array declaration of n size.
4. Input elements.
5. Initialize smallest element as arr[0].
6. Find the smallest element by checking for each index i from 1 to n-1 if arr[i] is greater than smallest, update smallest to arr[i].
7. Print the value of the variable smallest as output.
8. End.
