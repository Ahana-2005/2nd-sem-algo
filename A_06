//Write an algorithm for a C program to check elements of 2 arrays are equal or not.
1. Start.
2. Input from user the value of n.
3. 2 Arrays declaration of n size.
4. Input elements.
5. Compare arrays by initializing a variable count to 0 and for each index i from 0 to n-1, if arr[i] is not equal to brr[i], increment count by 1.
6. Check Equality as if count is 0, print "The arrays are equal.", otherwise, print "The arrays are not equal."
7. End.
