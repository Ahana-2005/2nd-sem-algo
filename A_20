//Write a C program to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.
1. Start.
2. Prompt the user to enter a number.
3. Call the recursive function fact with a as the argument to compute the factorial.
4. Base Case: If n is less than or equal to 1, return 1.
Recursive Case: Otherwise, return n multiplied by the result of fact(n-1).
5. Print the calculated factorial value stored in f.
6. End.
