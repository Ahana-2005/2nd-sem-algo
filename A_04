//Write an algorithm for a C program to find average of the elements in an array.
1. Start.
2. Input from user the value of n.
3. Array declaration of n size.
4. Input elements.
5. Calculate Sum by initializing the variable sum to 0 and for each index i from 0 to n-1, add the value of arr[i] to sum.
6. Calculate average by dividing sum by n and store it in avg.
7. Print the avg as output.
8. End
