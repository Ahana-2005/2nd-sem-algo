//Write an algorithm for c program to print the reverse of an array.
1. Start.
2. Input from user the value of n.
3. Array declaration of n size.
4. Input elements.
5. Use a loop to iterate from 0 to n/2 - 1 to swap the element at the current index with the element at the corresponding index from the end of the array and the swap is done using a temporary variable temp.
6. Print the Reversed Array.
7. End.
