//Write an algorithm for a c program to execute :-2,4,6,5
//4,24,720,120.
1. Start.
2. Input from user the value of n.
3. Array declaration of n size.
4. Input elements.
5. Calculate factorials by iterating over each index from 0 to n-1 and for each element arr[i], compute the factorial using the fact function and store the result in brr[i].
6. Print brr[i] by a loop.
7. End.
