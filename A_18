//Write a C program to calculate the factorial of a given number using function with pointer.
1. Start.
2. Initialize the main function.
3. Declare integer variables for input and result.
4. Prompt the user to enter a number for which the factorial will be calculated.
5. Check if the input number n is negative and if n is negative, print an error message indicating that factorials are not defined for negative numbers.
6. Use a loop to iterate from 1 to the value pointed to by n then multiply *result by each integer in the loop to compute the factorial.
7. Call the factorial function, passing the address of n and fact.
8. Print the computed factorial.
9. End.
