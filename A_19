//Write a C program to check a number is prime or not using function with pointer.
1. Start.
2. Initialize the main function and declare integer variables for the input number (n) and the result (p).
3. Prompt the user to enter a number to check for primality.
4. Initialize *isPrime to 1 and use a loop to test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of *n and if *n is divisible by any number i in this range (i.e., *n % i == 0), set *isPrime to 0 (not prime) and return.
5. Call the checkPrime function, passing the address of n and p and print result.
6. End.
