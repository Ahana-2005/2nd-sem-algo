//Write an algorithm for a program to check whether the sums of 2 arrays are same.
1. Start.
2. Input from user the value of n.
3. 2 Array declarations of n size.
4. Input elements for both the arrays.
5. Calculate Sum1 by initializing the variable sum to 0 and for each index i from 0 to n-1, add the value of arr[i] to sum.
6. Calculate Sum2 by initializing the variable sum to 0 and for each index i from 0 to n-1, add the value of brr[i] to sum.
7. Check if the sum1 and sum2 are equal then print "The sum of the arrays are equal." else print "The sum of the arrays are not equal."
8. End.
